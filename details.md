## Select multiple work items and open them in Excel
Sometimes you may want to select a specific set of work items from a query, not the entire query. To do this, select the work items you want (hold Shift to select multiple consecutive work items or Ctrl to select multiple work items) and use the Right-click on selected work items to "Open in Excel."
